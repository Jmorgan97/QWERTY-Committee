## 5. FAQs: <a name="faqs"></a>
- *How was this game made?*
-- Project Arizona was developed using Unity; a robust, free-to-use game development engine and platform. Unity uses C# as its base programming language. The game was developed by Jacob Morgan, Aidan Sorensen, and Thomas Myers -- computer science students at the University of Cincinnati between Fall 2022 and Spring 2023.

- *Will this game be available on other platforms?*
-- Maybe! Since Unity has many options built-in for compatibility or building/compiling/porting games to other platforms (desktop computers, mobile, VR, consoles, etc.) and already has robust controller comatibility support, it is possible that we might expand the game to work on other desktop operating systems, consoles, or more, or even release it through other means of distribution.
