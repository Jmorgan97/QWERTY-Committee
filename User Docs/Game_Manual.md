## 1. Info: <a name="info"></a>
Project Arizona is a third-person action adventure game created in the Unity game development engine by computer science students Jacob Morgan, Aidan Sorensen, and Thomas Myers at the University of Cincinnati for their senior design project. The game is free to download, install, and play in its limited demo form. Set in a fictional, modern day world in which the advancement of the world climate crisis effectively creates a post-apocalyptic wasteland in the American Southwest, the player character must gear up and explore the world, survive droughts and dust storms, fend off bandits, and help others survive the wastes as they learn how their decisions affect the world around them.

## 4. FAQs: <a name="faq"></a>
- *Why can't I rebind my controls?*
-- Some controls are locked down and cannot be rebound (such as the menu buttons like ESC) to prevent players from breaking the game. If players rebind or unbind some universal, necessary buttons, they could lock themselves out of using certain features or changing them back. If you have further questions about controls, please [contact us](https://github.com/Jmorgan97/QWERTY-Committee/blob/main/User%20Docs/User_Guide.md#contactus).

- *How was this game made?*
