### Abstract:
> We plan to develop a Unity game to showcase the skills weâ€™ve learned throughout our time here at UC as CS majors, engineers, and software designers. Set in the post-apocalyptic American west, the game features exploration, looting, resource management, crafting, farming, and other typical modern action game mechanics utilizing our understandings of data structures, PC architecture, graphics, software testing/QA, and other technical disciplines.

### "Project Arizona":
> Tentatively titled, Project Arizona is a 3D action adventure game set in a fictional post-apocalyptic American wasteland. The game is played primarily through a third-person camera, but may also have optional or situational first-person angles. Our goal is to develop a limited, but complete demonstrational  experience in which the player can learn the backstory of the game, familiarize themselves with the controls, and experience all of the major functions of the game, like looting and crafting, within a confined sandbox experience. We envision something similar to the opening cinematic and tutorial of a fully-fledged game, but with the ability to play around and get a feel for what a more complete, broader scope game might offer through a typical demo or trial version of those games.

### Budget
- Our budget for this game is $0. We have not currently spared any expenses towards the game and plan on using freely available or custom, self-made assets for the game. The computer hardware we currently each own individually should be adequate for developing the game. Unity is free, and we also plan on making the game free and easily shareable or accessible.

### Appendix
- We have a private GitHub repo for the Unity project code
- We've been meeting once a week with our advisor most weeks this semester and meet at least 30-60 minutes a week as a team to work on assignments together on top of our individual work as well as plan for our project. Individually, we've been watching and completing Unity tutorials and learnings to prepare ourselves to develop better and get more done next semester.
