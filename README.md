### 1. Abstract: <a name="abstract"></a>
> "Project Arizona" is a Unity game showcasing the skills weâ€™ve learned from our time here at the University of Cincinnati as CS majors, engineers, and software designers. The limited demo sandbox includes core gameplay mechanics in the base game that we developed to display our understandings of data structures, computer architecture, graphics, software testing/QA, and other technical disciplines.

### 1.(cont.) "Project Arizona" Description: <a name="description"></a>
> Project Arizona started as an idea for a 3D action/adventure/survival game set in a fictional post-apocalyptic American wasteland. The game is played through a third-person camera perspective. Our goal was to develop a limited, but complete demonstrational experience in which the player can get a feel for the setting of the game, familiarize themselves with the controls, and experience all of the major, basic character controller functions of the game, like exploration and looting, within a confined sandbox experience. We envisioned something similar to the opening cinematic and tutorial of a fully-fledged game, but with the ability to play around and see what a more complete, broader scope game might offer through a typical demo or trial version of those games.

- ### Initial Budget:
> #### "Our budget for this game was $0. We spared no expense in acquiring assets and used only freely available modeling and animation assets from Unity's own Asset Store, Mixamo (Adobe), Sketchfab, and other similar resources. We also used sound effects from Valve's Source engine games as placeholders."
