### 1. Abstract: <a name="abstract"></a>
> "Project Arizona" is a Unity game showcasing the skills weâ€™ve learned from our time here at the University of Cincinnati as CS majors, engineers, and software designers. The limited demo sandbox includes core gameplay mechanics in the base game that we developed to display our understandings of data structures, computer architecture, graphics, software testing/QA, and other technical disciplines.

### 1.(cont.) "Project Arizona" Description: <a name="description"></a>
> Project Arizona started as an idea for a 3D action/adventure/survival game set in a fictional post-apocalyptic American wasteland. The game is played through a third-person camera perspective. Our goal was to develop a limited, but complete demonstrational experience in which the player can get a feel for the setting of the game, familiarize themselves with the controls, and experience all of the major, basic character controller functions of the game, like exploration and looting, within a confined sandbox experience. We envisioned something similar to the opening cinematic and tutorial of a fully-fledged game, but with the ability to play around and see what a more complete, broader scope game might offer through a typical demo or trial version of those games.

### 3. Test Plan and Results: <a name="test"></a>
- #### [Initial Test Plan Document](https://github.com/Jmorgan97/QWERTY-Committee/blob/main/TestPlan.pdf)
> We ultimately did not follow our ideal, original test plan submission due to our project being in production up until the day of the expo, so testing was done actively, cyclicly throughout development by all team members. Due to the nature of game development and the way we worked in Unity's editor, testing contiunously, cyclicly throughout development was the best methodology for testing every small change or implementation for our project. We were unable to get outsiders to test our game before the expo, but some expo guests who visited our booth did test the app and find bugs for us in playtesting and demoing the build.

- ##### Aidan's Justification
> ##### Fall Semester: Our team met weekly. We often collaborated for over an hour during our weekly meetings. We also met weekly with our advisor starting about halfway through the fall sem, and these lasted from 15mins - 1 hr. After our weekly meetings, I would do some research and learn Unity for usually an hour or so until I took a break.
> ##### Spring Semester: At the beginning of the spring semester, we were working slowly and classes took most of our time. I also had some issues with my computer and had to completely reinstall my operating system(probably because I was triple booting Windows, linux, and a cracked MacOS lolol). Most of the Unity Development I did took place before the final week before the Expo, but due to our split progress, a LOT of time was spent combining our development into one Unity Project. This took up a lot of time mostly because we were using different input systems, which should've been avoided but it just never occurred to me that we might be setting things up with legacy/new systems. Something to remember for future projects. Regardless, the final push before the senior project revolved around us as a team sitting in Discord working for like 3 days straight fixing our build errors.

- ##### Jacob's Justification:
> ##### For the fall semester, our team met at least twice a week for an average of 2.5hrs a week over 10 weeks, as well as meeting with our advisor for an average of at least 30 minutes over 10 weeks. I spent roughly 10hrs in total preparing and setting up documents, updating our GitHub repo, and filling out assignment information for our team. Our advisor encouraged us to try and spend 15 minutes to an hour at least once a week trying to read, learn, or practice something related to our game, which I contributed about 10hrs to doing.
> ##### For the spring semester, I tried to work on our project at least once a week. I found that on average I would sit down at my computer and get sucked into editing in Unity in 4hr chunks after class, sometimes less, but more often I'd spend much longer than that on weekends, dedicating half a day or so. At one point past the middle of the semester I had issues with my personal desktop requiring a clean Windows installation that slowed down my work progress. About a week after this change, a problem with Windows 11 caused me to lose all of project files and I had to restore my work from a backup, losing an entire week's worth of progress. A great chunk of the hours I spent on this project were after this time, especially in the final week before the expo, as I tried to recreate, rebuild, and improve upon my work while trying to catch up to our goals.

|**Total**||**75 hrs**|**100%**|

- ##### Thomas's Justification:
> ##### For the fall semester, we were having meetings twice a week to discuss how things were going on each of our ends, along with setting goals to meet before the next meeting. Our advisor made time for us to meet every week for up to an hour. These meetings were essential for keeping us on track. We would work together for each of the fall semester assignments that needed to be done. On our own, we each did research into how to build and edit unity projects. Our advisor challenged us to try to work just a little bit on the project every day, and that worked out wonderfully.
> ##### For the spring semester, we continued to have check-in meetings to see our progress and set new goals. Assignments, like in the fall, were done together throughout the semester. During the early part of the semester, I tried to continue to work on learning c++ and unity a little bit every day, but it was much harder to maintain and I had to catch myself up multiple times after missing days. The Pocedural generation was my baby for this project. I spent so much time learning and coding out a solution from a guide, that I got seriously burned out. It wasn't until I made serious progress to the point where I could actually see land being generated, that I felt some relief and that this idea was worth it to pursue. I wanted to get to the point of having procedurally generated dungeons, but I learned pretty quick that I would sadly not reach that stretch goal. The final week before the expo was insanity. We were all hands on deck for almost every waking hour. I was mostly troubleshooting how to get my part of the project to work with rest of what we had built. This was in vain however, as the two systems just refused to work together. We ended up bringing two different systems to the expo to show the game demo seperate from the procedural generation.

#### Team Totals:
|Team Member|Hours Committed|
|-----------|---------------|
|Aidan Sorensen|135 hrs|
|Jacob Morgan|140 hrs|
|Thomas Myers|130 hrs|

- ##### Team Justification:
> ##### Our team overall met regularly, in a more structured fashion during the first semester, but still at least once a week in some capacity in the second semester. Due to higher course load struggles, schedule mismatches, and difficulty finding time to work on the project separately, we did struggle to work the way we wanted to. But, we are still rpoud of the product of our work and worked tirelessly to make a complete project. Much of our second semester involved non-stop working on our courseload and using all free time to work on the project where space could not be carved out specifically for it. We continued to meet on Discord and track our progress with regular updates to each other on our work with screenshots or comments, screensharing over voice chat, and sharing bulleted lists of tasks to do or expectations from each member.

### 9. Summary of Expenses: <a name="expenses"></a>
> We spent $0 in developing this game as Unity is a free game development engine, we used freely available community or public assets, and we did not release our game for an official, published release for profit. The game was developed on our own personal computers with Unity, Visual Studio, Photoshop, and Audacity. For the expo, we did spend money on supplies for our booth, including $8 for hand sanitizer, $25 for a Logitech MK235 mouse and keyboard combo, and $10 on mousepads, for a total of roughly $47 after tax. We additionally brought our laptops, cables, power/adapters, peripherals, and monitors to best present our work at the expo.

- #### Initial Budget:
> ##### "Our budget for this game was $0. We spared no expense in acquiring assets and used only freely available modeling and animation assets from Unity's own Asset Store, Mixamo (Adobe), Sketchfab, and other similar resources. We also used sound effects from Valve's Source engine games as placeholders."
