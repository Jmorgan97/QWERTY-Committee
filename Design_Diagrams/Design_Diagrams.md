# Part 2: Design Diagrams

Design Diagrams are graphical depictions of what your project will do with focus on identified inputs and outputs. For this assignment you will create 3 diagrams, each with increasing detail:


### Design D0
- *Gives the highest level view of your project identifying basic input and output to system*

    ``The first design diagram gives a broad overview of the basic idea of the game. The user can find our game online, launch it,         and hopefully enjoy themself when playing.
    `` 

### Design D1
- *Elaborate design of several modules or subsystems given in D0*

    ``The second design diagram begins to get a little bit more specific. The user still has to be able to find our game, but now they download it and are able to execute the game on their computer. The user then still gets to play the game, but now we're a little more specific. They can determine a little bit about what they want their playstyle to be and they can explore the virtual world around them.``

### Design D2
- *A further elaboration on D1, giving the most details concerning your system. Always include your project title and goal statement.*

    ``The last design diagram is the most specific and most useful for understanding the end-goal of the project. Just like in the second design diagram, the user downloads and installs the game, then executes the code to launch it. Then, they can choose to make a new game or continue with a saved file. This facilitates the need for reading a local file, and then plugging back into a place where the user can develop they playstyle in an RPG-like world. They can explore, progress, and learn about the world around them and hopefully enjoy their experience. And in the end, maybe the user will even learn something about themselves.``


### Conventions
- what do boxes or figures mean?
    - An ellipse is a starting box that represents the beginning state of the user. 
    - A square/rectangle is a process, something that maybe combines an action the user takes with computer processes like downloading/installing a game.
    - A parallelogram is an action that the player takes directly, like downloading the game, running the game etc.
    - A diamond represents a decision. For this shape, the decision is really something within the game. Many decisions were made up to this point, but the diamond represents decisions the user can make within context of our project. Not, say, choosing to download the game.
- what do lines between them represent?
    - The lines represent the flow of the project. In our diagrams, generally the flow is left to right, so it should flow naturally as if read normally.
