# Part 2: Design Diagrams

Design Diagrams are graphical depictions of what your project will do with focus on identified inputs and outputs. For this assignment you will create 3 diagrams, each with increasing detail:

• Design D0: gives the highest level view of your project identifying basic input and output to system • Design D1: elaborate design of several modules or subsystems given in D0 • Design D2: a further elaboration on D1, giving the most details concerning your system. Always include your project title and goal statement. Explain diagram conventions: • what do boxes or figures mean? • what do lines between them represent? • graphical depiction of what your project will do • focus on inputs and outputs

Examples: If you download the sample Fall Design Reports you will find good examples of Design Diagrams.
