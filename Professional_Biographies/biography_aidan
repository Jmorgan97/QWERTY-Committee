## COOP Work Experience
### First Solar
#### ***(3 semesters)***
*CLIP Integration Intern*, First Solar, Perrysburg, Ohio
- Completed 3 rotations working in First Solar's Development Engineering Department
- I scripted in JMP Statistical Software and completed a couple I/O assignments to control buttons on tools in C#
- Participated in statistical analysis course, and I think I technically got certified through JMP/SAS
- Most of my work revolved around scripting statistical models from queries of data subsets from experiments. Basically, I helped take measurements and used the data recorded in a server to conduct analysis and make charts and presentations from it
- I grew pretty comfortable presenting and talking about metrics with other engineers


### Michigan Tech Research Institute
#### ***(2 semesters)***
*Research intern*, MTRI, Ann Arbor, Michigan
- At MTRI, I worked on a couple larger projects as well as a couple personal projects that could be applied to the larger ongoing projects
- I learned a lot of linux and bash, as that's how most of the developers worked and I became very comfortable in ubuntu specifically
- Completed a personal project scripting and developing an automatic documentation generator through Sphinx, using a bash script. 
- Was introduced to CI/CD concepts and applied gitlab runners to automatic documentation page updating whenever commits were made to a project on git
- Wrote a testing framework for computational functions to certify accuracy and precision in python(using Pytest)
- Developed multiple algorithms on a project that was focused on developing small drones that could map a distribution of(hypothetically) gas in a given area.
  - kernel DM+V algorithm to search a grid and use gaussian distributions find a very close approximation of plumes
  - Began implementing a simple and complicated version of a djikstra pathfinding algorithm for more complex spaces with walls
  - Developed these algorithms and worked with senior researchers to optimize and improve the methodology used in the Python code
  
## Project Sought

I'm pretty comfortable with Python and other languages that have been studied in school, so I don't feel constricted with
my programming options. I'd really like to do something with strong environmental/social/infrastructure themes.
Neither of my coops were PAL companies because I really wanted to get into renewable energy with First Solar, and MTRI 
does a lot of remote sensing work that applies directly to environmental research. Plant life, water life, watersheds,
wildfire containment, and other things like that. While I didn't work on any of those projects at MTRI, it is a small office and I'm
definitely drawn to that kind of research and development. 

I had a couple generic thoughts about a plant watering app but it seems like that has been done A LOT.

I think a machine learning project would be fun, I haven't done a lot with neural networks so I think it would be cool to develop my skills there

### Other Ideas
- A more dynamic and useful map of, say, a college campus. A helpful app that can show a 3-dimensional ish map of a specific building or area and provide steps to get there
  - I don't think I would want to use GPS for this, as 3D GPS stuff gets pretty tough
- An app or website that helps you find places to recycle. My house in clifton doesn't even have recycling bins anymore so I've been exploring finding places to recycle on my own. It would be very nice to have a tool that can help me find places to recycle. Maybe this already exists, but I'm just spitballing.
- I don't know if it's valid to do research for a senior design project, but I'd love to network with people who are interested in applying computer science to active research fields that I mentioned above: environmentalism, conservation, infrastructure.
- A while back I wanted to make an app that helped make public transportation more accessible with a phone, but recently plenty of tools have emerged that help with that. Although ezfare actually sucks, but I don't think improving on the ticketing system in-app constitutes a whole project. I was pretty inspired by NYC's subway/bus ticket system on the phone, and I would love to make a concept of that in a way that could be replicated more easily in other cities.
- Since I have experience with python, and I did a lot of work with documentation/testing(in python), I can definitely help with backend. I'm also pretty familiar with scientific methods since a lot of what I've been doing fore past 4 years has been either development engineering or research.

Some of my hobbies outside school/work include: hiking, backpacking, running, swimming, playing piano/guitar(i'm not good at either), and playing video games.
I'm big into games like Valheim, minecraft, and other survival games but I mostly play Valorant and CSGO.

Game development would also be pretty cool. It doesn't necessarily satisfy my interest in the environment or conservation, but I've always wanted to make a game of some sort.
Ideas for games:
- 2d game with stardew valley vibes for habitat restoration. Like add wildlife/local plant stuff into it.
- Concept for a procedurally generated polygon art/ pixel art survival game. Or not survival, maybe a roguelike.

- Another idea is a social media dedicated to music recommendations. I use spotify and I've used Apple music as well as soundcloud and other apps, and all of them aren't really what I'm looking for to share music. Sometimes I want to share music to people but I don't want to put it on my story or dm it to people.
  - What are you listening to right now? What's been on repeat? Something that can embed all the platforms and basically link to any of your preferred streaming services for any given song or record that's been shared. 
  - stretch goal: sharing a playlist that can be replicated by the app to whatever service you use. For instance, it's kinda a pain to replicate a spotify playlist on apple music. And it's that way for a reason, apple and Spotify don't work together. But something that could act as a middle man to consolidate music a little bit and add a social aspect could be pretty cool
