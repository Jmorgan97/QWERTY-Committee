## Milestones:
- Finalize themes/style/design/gameplay concepts
- Plan programming/logic (flowcharts, etc.)
- Standardize and build framework (data structures, naming schemes, etc.)
- Create prototyping sandbox environment (our "engine")
- Develop core gameplay control features and functions (being the character)
- Develop UX (menus, meta features and functions outside core gameplay)
- Complete and implement art assets (visual/audio)
- Complete testing and validation (end)
- Final tweaks (polish)
- Deliverable game (proof of concept)

Basically; figure out what we're doing -> plan accordingly -> set up necessary things in place -> make a basic platform to build off of -> start programming and implementing features and placeholder assets -> test along the way -> add bigger, less important, or higher level features -> add the real art assets to make it feel like a real game -> test test test -> fix it -> finish it
